                <p>SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic<br> milestones. It is the only private company capable of returning a<br> spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, and in 2012 our Dragon spacecraft<br> became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to and<br> from the International Space Station. And in 2020, SpaceX became <br>the first private company to take humans there as well. Click <br>through the timeline above to see some of our milestone<br>accomplishments.</p>

With more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff,<br> Falcon Heavy is one of the most capable rockets flying. By <br>comparison, the liftoff thrust of the Falcon Heavy equals<br> approximately eighteen 747 aircraft at full power.
