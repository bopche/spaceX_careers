       <h1 class="text-2" >STARSHIPS ARE MEANT TO FLY</h1>

       <P class="paragraph-1">SpaceX was founded in 2002 to expand access to outer space. Not just for government or traditional satellite
         operators, but for new participants around the<br> globe. Today, we’re flying at an unprecedented pace as the world’s most active
          launch services provider. SpaceX is safely and reliably launching astronauts,<br>satellites, and other payloads on missions benefiting
           life on Earth and preparing humanity for our ultimate goal: to explore other planets in our solar system <br>and beyond.</P>

       <p class="paragraph-1">Starship is paramount to making that sci-fi future, along with a growing number of U.S. national priorities, 
        a reality. It is the largest and most powerful space<br> transportation system ever developed, and its fully and rapidly reusable
         design will exponentially increase humanity’s ability to access and utilize outer space.<br> Full reusability has been an elusive 
         goal throughout the history of spaceflight, piling innumerable technical challenges on what is already the most difficult<br>
          engineering pursuit in human existence. It is rocket science, on ludicrous mode.</p>

       <p class="paragraph-1">Every flight of Starship has made tremendous progress and accomplished increasingly difficult test
         objectives, making the entire system more capable and </br>more reliable. Our approach of putting flight hardware in the flight
          environment as often as possible maximizes the pace at which we can learn recursively</br> and operationalize the system.
           This is the same approach that unlocked reuse on our Falcon fleet of rockets and made SpaceX the leading launch<br> provider
            in the world today.</p>

       <p class="paragraph-1">To do this and do it rapidly enough to meet commitments to national priorities 
        like NASA’s Artemis program, Starships need to fly. The more we fly safely,</br> the faster we learn; 
        the faster we learn, the sooner we realize full and rapid rocket reuse. Unfortunately, we continue to be
         stuck in a reality where it takes longer</br> to do the government paperwork to license a rocket launch than 
         it does to design and build the actual hardware. This should never happen and directly</br> threatens America’s 
         position as the leader in space.</p>

       <h1 class="text-3">FLIGHT 5</h1>

       <p class="paragraph-1">The Starship and Super Heavy vehicles for Flight 5 have been ready to launch since the first week of August. The flight test will include our most ambitious</br> objective yet: attempt to return the Super Heavy booster to the launch site and catch it in mid-air.</p>
