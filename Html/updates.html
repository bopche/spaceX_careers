       <h1 class="text-2" >STARSHIPS ARE MEANT TO FLY</h1>
       <P class="paragraph-1">SpaceX was founded in 2002 to expand access to outer space. Not just for government or traditional satellite
         operators, but for new participants around the<br> globe. Today, we’re flying at an unprecedented pace as the world’s most active
          launch services provider. SpaceX is safely and reliably launching astronauts,<br>satellites, and other payloads on missions benefiting
           life on Earth and preparing humanity for our ultimate goal: to explore other planets in our solar system <br>and beyond.</P>

       <p class="paragraph-1">Starship is paramount to making that sci-fi future, along with a growing number of U.S. national priorities, 
        a reality. It is the largest and most powerful space<br> transportation system ever developed, and its fully and rapidly reusable
         design will exponentially increase humanity’s ability to access and utilize outer space.<br> Full reusability has been an elusive 
         goal throughout the history of spaceflight, piling innumerable technical challenges on what is already the most difficult<br>
          engineering pursuit in human existence. It is rocket science, on ludicrous mode.</p>

       <p class="paragraph-1">Every flight of Starship has made tremendous progress and accomplished increasingly difficult test
         objectives, making the entire system more capable and </br>more reliable. Our approach of putting flight hardware in the flight
          environment as often as possible maximizes the pace at which we can learn recursively</br> and operationalize the system.
           This is the same approach unlocked reuse on our Falcon fleet of rockets and made SpaceX the leading</br> launch provider
            in the world today.</p>

       <p class="paragraph-1">To do this and do it rapidly enough to meet commitments to national priorities 
        like NASA’s Artemis program, Starships need to fly. The more we fly safely,</br> the faster we learn; 
        the faster we learn, the sooner we realize full and rapid rocket reuse. Unfortunately, we continue to be
         stuck in a reality where it takes</br> longer to do the government paperwork to license a rocket launch than 
         it does to design and build the actual hardware. This should never happen and directly</br> threatens America’s 
         position as the leader in space.</p>

       <h1 class="text-3">FLIGHT 5</h1>

       <p class="paragraph-1">The Starship and Super Heavy vehicles for Flight 5 have been ready to launch since the first week of August. The flight test will include our most ambitious</br> objective yet: attempt to return the Super Heavy booster to the launch site and catch it in mid-air.</p>

       <img class="img333" src="../Images/updates-3.jpg"/>

       <h3 class="Text-4"><b>Returning the booster after launch is a core capability to Starship becoming rapidly and reliably reusable</b></h3>

       <p class="paragraph-1">This will be a singularly novel operation in the history of rocketry. SpaceX 
        engineers have spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch </br>attempt, with technicians
         pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure to maximize our chances for success. Every test
          comes with risk,</br> especially those seeking to do something for the first time. SpaceX goes to the maximum extent
           possible on every flight to ensure that while we are</br> accepting risk to our own hardware, we accept no compromises
            when it comes to ensuring public safety.</p>

       <p class="paragraph-1">It's understandable that such a unique operation would require additional time to analyze from a 
        licensing perspective. Unfortunately, instead of focusing </br>resources on critical safety analysis and collaborating on
         rational safeguards to protect both the public and the environment, the licensing process has been </br>repeatedly derailed 
         by issues ranging from the frivolous to the patently absurd. At times, these roadblocks have been driven by false and misleading 
         reporting,</br> built on bad-faith hysterics from online detractors or special interest groups who have presented poorly constructed 
         science as fact.</p>

       
       <p class="paragraph-1">We recently received a launch license date estimate of late November from the FAA, the government agency 
        responsible for licensing Starship flight tests.</br> This is a more than two-month delay to the previously communicated date of
         mid-September. This delay was not based on a new safety concern, but instead </br>driven by superfluous environmental analysis.
          The four open environmental issues are illustrative of the difficulties launch companies face in the current</br> regulatory 
          environment for launch and reentry licensing.</p>

      <h1 class="text-5">STEEL AND WATER</h1>

      <p class="paragraph-1"> Starship’s water-cooled steel flame deflector has been the target of false reporting, wrongly alleging that
         it pollutes the environment or has operated </br>completely independent of regulation. This narrative omits fundamental facts
          that have either been ignored or intentionally misinterpreted.</p>

      <img class="img333" src="../Images/image-update.jpeg"/>

      <p class="paragraph-1">At no time did SpaceX operate the deflector without a permit. SpaceX was operating in good faith under a
         Multi-Sector General Permit to cover deluge</br>operations under the supervision of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).
          SpaceX worked closely with TCEQ to incorporate numerous</br> mitigation measures prior to its use, including the installation of 
          retention basins, construction of protective curbing, plugging of outfalls during operations</br> and use of only potable (drinking)
           water that does not come into contact with any industrial processes. A permit number was assigned and made active in July</br> 
           2023. TCEQ officials were physically present at the first testing of the deluge system and given the opportunity to observe operations 
           around launch.</p>


           <p class="paragraph-1">When the EPA issued its Administrative Order in March 2024, it was done before seeking a basic understanding of the facts of the water-cooled steel</br> flame deflector’s operation or acknowledgement that we were operating under the Texas Multi-Sector General Permit. After meeting with the EPA—during which the </br>EPA stated their intent was not to stop testing, preparation, or launch operations—it was decided that </br>SpaceX should apply for an individual discharge permit. Despite our previous permitting, which was done in coordination with TCEQ,and our operation</br>having little to nothing in common with industrial waste discharges covered by individual permits, </br>we applied for an individual permit in July 2024.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-1">The subsequent fines levied on SpaceX by TCEQ and the EPA are entirely tied to disagreements over paperwork. We chose to settle so that we can</br> focus our energy on completing the missions and commitments that we have made to the U.S. government, commercial customers, and ourselves.</br> Paying fines is extremely disappointing when we fundamentally disagree with the allegations, and we are supported by the fact that EPA has agreed that</br> nothing about the operation of our flame deflector will need to change.</br> Only the name of the permit has changed.</p>
