SpaceX believes a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the pivotal<br> breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space<br> access. The majority of the launch cost comes from building the<br> rocket, which historically has flown only once.<br>
<br>
Compare that to a commercial airliner â€“ each new plane costs about <br>the same as Falcon 9 but can fly multiple times per day and conduct<br> tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime. Following the <br>commercial model, a rapidly reusable space launch vehicle could <br>reduce the cost of traveling to space by a hundredfold.<br>
<br>

While most rockets are designed to burn up on reentry, SpaceX<br> rockets can not only withstand reentry but can also successfully land <br>back on Earth and refly again.</p>

     SpaceX tests its engines, vehicle structures, and systems at a 4,000-acre state-of-the-art rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas. Outfitted with 16 specialized test stands, the facility validates for flight every Merlin engine that powers the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, and every Draco thruster that controls the Dragon spacecraft.
